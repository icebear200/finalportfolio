      <h3> Hi! I'm Angie, a junior at Brown University studying Computer Science with a focus on Design. I love creating artful and intiutive 
        websites with good user flow and accessibility. I have front-end epxerience in HTML, CSS, and React, and Figma, as well as some backend experience in Java. I'm hoping to 
        pursure a career in fintech and am passionate about learning more about technologies that make finanical systems more efficient. This summer I will be 
        an analyst at an investment bank and am excited to work with the fintech team where I will learn more about the intersection of tech and finance. I am orginally from New York City and spent the first couple years of my 
        life growing up in Ghana where my family lives.  </h3>
