        <h3> Sort, Filter, and Aggregator Functionality in React App</h3>
        <p> 
         I was tasked with creating a React App that filters, sort, and aggregates data. I decided to create a playlsit organization app that allows
         users to sort songs in a library or playlist by genre and artist, and filter alphabetically my song title. Users could also add and remove songs in the library 
         to their "Favorite Song" list which tells them how many minutes they've spent listening to their favorite songs.

       <p> 
       I have playlists that are so long and disorganized-- essentially song libraries with songs from all genres I've liked at some point over the past couple of years.
       Creating new playlists are a challenge for me because I'm not quite sure how to categorize my diverse music taste and enjoy the surprise of wildly different songs playing back to back.
       But sometimes it becomes difficult to find a song of a particular genre or artist I want to listen to in my long playlist. Aditionally, my favorite songs 
       change often and I want to have some component that shows me my up to date favorite songs.

I intitally planned to have the favorited songs render as the only components on the page, but realized that didn't make as much sense. It made better sense to have the favorite songs render as a list on the right side of the page so that users could continue to filter and sort their library after favoriting songs. I also added a remove from favorites button to allow users to edit their favorite song list.

 <div class="takeawayDescription"> <p> 
    This project me the significance of a thoguhtful planning/sketching process before beginnig to code. Looking back, I should've created multiple
    design layouts and drawn from the best features in those designs to create a final sketch my design would be based on. I had to be very adaptable during this project
    becaue ideas I initally had did not always make the best sense for a playlist. 
  </p> 

   <p> If I were to redo this project, I'd implement pickers rather than checkboxes for the filtering options to create a cleaner design. I'd also think about creating a 
    vertical layout to make the library resemble a more traditional playlist and to create a cleaner design because feedback from users have suggested that the layout is congested. </p>
