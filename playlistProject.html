        <h3> Sort, Filter, and Aggregator Functionality in React App</h3>
        <p> 
          I took on the challenge of building a React app that could filter, sort, and aggregate data. 
         I decided to build a playlist organization app because I love music. This app allows users to organize their songs within 
          a library or playlist by genre and artist, and sort them alphabetically by song title. Additionally, 
          users can add and remove songs from their library to a "Favorite Songs" list, which also tracks the total time spent listening to their favorite songs.
        </p>

       <p> 
        I have long, disorganized playlists that essentially function as song libraries, containing songs from various genres that I've liked over the past couple of years.
        Creating new playlists is challenging for me because I'm unsure how to categorize my diverse music taste and enjoy the surprise of different songs playing back-to-back.
        However, it's difficult to find specific songs by genre or artist in my long playlist. Additionally, my favorite songs change often, so I wanted a way to keep track of that.

    <div class="researchDescription">  
    <h2> Research that Influenced my Work:</h2> 
    <p> For my research, I conducted a comparative analysis of websites with sort, filter, 
      and aggregator functionalities. I specifically looked at sites like Revolve, Expedia, and Shein,
      which are well-known for their effective data displays and have different ways of sorting, filtering, 
      and aggregating data. I chose these sites over music platforms because their data displays were more aligned with how 
      I wanted to design my music library, which is currently disorganized. This analysis helped me identify features I wanted to 
      implement in my project. This data allowed me to gather inspiration for how different information is filtered, sorted, and 
      aggregated and how the results of these functions are displayed.

<div class="Process"> 
    <div class="processSectionInfo"> 
        <div class="processSummary"> <p> During the development process, I started by sketching 
          out various ideas for how I wanted the song components to appear on the page and considering how
           users would interact with different functionalities. As I progressed with coding, I found myself making 
           adjustments to the design for better user flow. I also had to change some of my initial ideas to make sure 
           I could meet the deadline. Check out how my design for each component changed over time.

            <div class ="processDiv">  
                <div class="processInfo"> <p>  In my initial sketch, I envisioned using a Picker for 
                  filtering categories. However, when I tried to code this, I had trouble getting the 
                  Picker to work correctly, and with the deadline approaching, I needed to find a solution quickly.
                   I decided to adapt my design and utilize checkboxes instead. This way, users could check the artist 
                   or genre they wished to filter by. Checkboxes were an effective alternative but do make the design a bit 
                   messier than I envisioned. Once a user selects an artist or genre, the library of songs is replaced with the
                    filtered results.

              <div class="processInfo"> <p> My design for favoriting songs also changed when I began coding. 
                Initially, I planned to display favorited songs as the only components on the page, but I soon 
                realized this approach didn't make much sense because then users could not continue to sort and filter
                 songs once they favorited a song. I decided it would be more practical to render the favorite songs as a 
                 list on the right side of the page. This way, users could still interact with the rest of their library as they added songs 
                 to their favorites. Additionally, I added a "remove from favorites" button to allow users to easily update and remove songs from their favorite list.

  <div class="takeawaysTitle"> <h3> TAKEAWAYS</h3></div>
 <div class="takeawayDescription"> <p> 
  This project taught me the importance of thoughtful planning and sketching before diving into coding. 
  In hindsight, I realize I should have created multiple design layouts and selected the best features
   from each to create a final sketch as the basis for my design. I learned to be adaptable because some of 
   my initial ideas didn't always make the most sense for a playlist.
  </p> 

   <p> If I were to redo this project, I would opt for pickers instead of checkboxes for the 
    filtering options to achieve a cleaner design. Additionally, I would consider implementing a vertical
     layout to make the library resemble a more traditional playlist. Feedback from users has indicated that the 
     current layout feels congested, so this change could improve the overall design and user experience. </p>
