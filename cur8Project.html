        <h3> Empowering Companies to Take the Lead on Climate Change</h3>
        <p> 
CUR8, a UK-based company, specializes in designing carbon removal portfolio solutions.
 Their website enables users to input their carbon removal goals and budget, and curates for them a summary portfolio of
  purchasable carbon removal credits. However, their current flow lacks a purchase option. I collaborated with a team of peers in my front-end design course
  to design a high-fidelity prototype purchase flow for CUR8's website.
        </p>
    </div>
  

    <div  class="problemSectionInfo">   
       <div class="problemTitle">    <h2> THE PROBLEM</h2>  </div>
       <div class="problemDescription">   
       <p> 
The current CUR8 site allows users to select carbon credits for purchase, but lacks an option to request purchasing the portfolio.
 Customers must currently communicate with CUR8 staff to finalize their portfolios before purchase. To improve this process, we aimed to
 enable customers to review their portfolio, provide feedback, invite collaborators to the portfolio, and submit a purchase request that can be approved for direct purchase.
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="researchSectionInfo"> 

  <div class="mattersDescription"> <h4> Why it Matters:</h4> 
     <p> Creating an online purchase flow option will enable CUR8 to run more efficiently and to service more customers, driving sales. Importantly,
        giving customers the choice to purchase carbon credits online will help drive the reduction of carbon emissions and promote a greener future.  </p> </div>

  <div class="researchTitle">  <h2> RESEARCH </h2></div>
    <div class="researchDescription">  
    <h2> Research that Influenced my Work:</h2> 
    <p> 
      In our research for designing the purchase flow, we analyzed various website purchase flows. It was challenging because we couldn't find companies with a similar service and a purchase flow on their site. This made us think critically about what would be most effective.
      </p>
     <p> Typically, users can review the contents of their cart before purchasing. However, since CUR8's customers would be purchasing curated portfolios with detailed information about carbon removal, including tonnes removed, geography, and type of removal, we needed to present this information in a clear and digestible way for users to review before making a purchase request.
    </p>

    <p> 
      This purchase flow is tailored for CFOs and other company executives who make purchases on behalf of their organizations.

    <h3> First Iteration Wireframing</h3>
        <div class="firstIntInfo">  
            <p> During our first iteration of wireframing, we synthesized the best ideas from our team's sketches to craft 
              detailed wireframes. We focused on enhancing the portfolio breakdown to provide a detailed report. 
              We also introduced a sharing feature that allows users to share their portfolio with colleagues for review before 
              finalizing the purchase.

    </div>
 <div class="arrow"> </div>
    <h3> Second Iteration Wireframing</h3>
    <div class="secondItInfo">  
    <p> After speaking with the CUR8 team, we refined the portfolio breakdown to include important metrics such as project type and supplier company. 
      This was important to ensure that invited stakeholders receive the same breakdown as the user. Additionally, we included a "skip" option to streamline the process 
      for users who didn't need to add stakeholders. We changed our purchasing step to a purchase request form rather than a direct purchase option
       after talking to the CUR8 team. This is because CUR8 needs to approve the portfolio to ensure the credits are available for purchase before users can proceed. 
       Given that many transactions involved large sums, we recognized that direct credit card payments were not suitable.
       A critical aspect of this step and our design was creating a separate flow for invited stakeholders. 
       This allowed us to showcase what invited stakeholders would see.

    <h3> Third Iteration Hi-Fidelity</h3>
    <div class="thirdIntInfo">  
        <p> We developed a high-fidelity prototype in line with CUR8's color palette and branding guidelines. To invite stakeholders, we implemented a pop-up box on the portfolio summary page, clearly indicating that this page would be shared with stakeholders. After users completed or skipped this step, they would review a portfolio summary, presented like a receipt to simulate a checkout experience. 
          Following this, users would submit a purchase request.

</div>




  <div class="finalSolutionInfo"> 
    <div class="solutionTitle"> <h3>SOLUTION</h3></div>
    
    <p> We met with the CUR8 team to refine our design based on their feedback. 
      We decided to remove the filtering option from the portfolio breakdown page since most portfolios don't 
      include a wide variety of project types. When users are ready to submit a purchase request, we remind them to invite a stakeholder if they skipped that step earlier. 
      Additionally, on the purchase request page, we provide more transparency by explaining that CUR8 must approve the portfolio before purchase. Lastly, 
      users will receive a notification from CUR8 once their request is approved so they can complete their purchase
</p>

<p> Impact: By incorporating CUR8's feedback, we crafted a purchase flow that delighted the CUR8 team.
   Our design enables customers to collaborate seamlessly using a chat system with colleagues to review portfolios 
   and provide feedback, which the CUR8 team can easily access. We also included a receipt-like summary of the customer's 
   portfolio, resembling the familiar online shopping cart experience. This approach enhances transparency between CUR8 and its clients,
    guiding them through the purchasing process and clarifying the next steps.

  <div class="takeawaysTitle"> <h3> TAKEAWAYS</h3></div>
 <div class="takeawayDescription"> <p> 
  This project taught me how to brainstorm with a team and pull the best features from each of our ideas to create a strong design. Synthesizing the best ideas from different sketches was more challenging than I expected, and then actually translating the sketches into hi-fidelity prototypes also had its challenges.

This project also taught me more about professionalism, as our work had a significant impact on a real company that does important work in addressing climate change.
</p> 
<p>  Add Ons: The next step for this project is designing the flow once users receive approval from CUR8 to purchase their portfolio.

  <div class="roleTitle"> <h3> MY ROLE</h3></div>
 <div class="roleDescription">    <p> I worked with a talented team of peers for this project. 
  I created sketches and designed the feedback chat feature for invited stakeholders. I also created Loom videos walking the CUR8 team
  through our designs. I collaborated with my design team to incorporate feedback from CUR8, our peers, and professors.
