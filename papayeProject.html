        <h3> A Hidden Gem: Papaye Restaurant in New York City</h3>
        <p>  
          One of my treasured spots in New York City is Papaye Restaurant, a local family-run gem in the Bronx serving delicious Ghanaian 
          and African dishes that resonate with my upbringing in Ghana. For this project, I took on the task of 
          revamping Papaye's outdated site and ensuring a smoother user experience while staying true to the authentic flavors that Papaye embodies.

       <div class="problemTitle">    <h2> THE PROBLEM</h2>  </div>
       <div class="problemDescription">   
       <p> 
        The original Papaye site, created in 2006, has seen little updating since then. The homepage, dark and 
        outdated, suffers from corrupted image files that fail to load, leaving it mostly empty with just a black
         background. Despite having a food gallery with updating images of the dishes the restaurant offers, the images don't load, 
        creating a lack of visual appeal that fails to showcase Papaye's delicious offerings. Because of this, the site lacks a clear 
        color theme and brand identity. This low contrast and lack of imagery might lead users to believe the site is out-of-date and 
        exit the site prematurely before viewing information about the restaurant's food offerings and locations.

  <div class="mattersDescription"> <h4> Why it Matters:</h4>  
    <p> Choosing to address and update the issues on Papaye's website was important because it provided a free design solution 
      to a small business run by local African immigrants for whom this restaurant is the achievement of their American dream. Further, 
      the improvements I made to the site will help attract and retain customers, improve accessibility, and help Papaye create a stronger
      and more recognizable brand identity.
     </p> </div>

  <div class="researchTitle">  <h2> RESEARCH </h2></div>
    <div class="researchDescription">  
    <h2> Research that Influenced my Work:</h2> 
    <p>  I conducted a comparative analysis of other restaurant sites to see what worked best.  I liked sites with simple designs because they had a clear user flow.
      I also noticed a lot of sites utilized flat designs for buttons and links which helped create a more modern feel that I wanted to bring to  Papaye's site. 
     Additionally, all these sites had a strong sense of branding either through color palettes, fonts, or themes. This influenced me to  be thoughtful and look for fonts 
     and color palettes that would complement the diverse and colorful foods I wanted to display on Papaye's site through the food gallery. 
    </p>

    <p> The audience of this site is mainly New York City locals who are familiar restaurant. With little to no advertising, the restaurant 
      relies on proximity and word of mouth for recognition. Primarily, patrons are Ghanaian and other African immigrants seeking familiar cuisine. 
      However, the restaurant also attracts a diverse crowd due to its location in a predominantly immigrant area.

      Additionally, I incorporated "View on Map" buttons, which my previous designs lacked. Including this allows users to 
      to easily navigate from their location to the restaurant, improving my overall user flow.   </p>

<div class="solutionSectionInfo"> 
  <div class="solutionTitle"> <h3>SOLUTION</h3></div>
 <div class="solutionDescription">  
  <p>  To address these issues, I redesigned the website into a single-page format that streamlines all the information. At the top, I added a navigation bar with buttons for easy scrolling to the "About" and "Hours and Location" sections. I also updated the "Order Online" button to directly link to the restaurant's Doordash ordering page.

    For a cohesive look, I used a white background, consistent color palette, and font theme throughout the site. The centerpiece of the redesign is a food gallery that showcases the restaurant's offerings with updating images, creating a visually appealing and informative experience for users.

  This redesign taught me to be adaptable. While my final design didn't stray too far from my original vision, I had to make some sacrifices to prioritize accessibility. I changed my color palette, font style, and some images to ensure better contrast and readability for users. This process also highlighted the importance of branding, as I aimed to balance modernity with the restaurant's authenticity.
